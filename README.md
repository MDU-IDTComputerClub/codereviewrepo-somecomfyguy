# Computer Club Code Review
This template project shall be used to upload a project for code review sessions in the Computer Club.

# Steps
1) Clone the repository to your computer using either command line git or GitHub Desktop.
2) Add your project to the repository. 
3) Push it to the remote project in the github classroom repository. 
* A pull request should automatically be created, allowing others to comment on the code.

# Utilities
To reduce the uploading of unnecessary files, please create a .gitignore file for your project. Typical things to ignore are cache and build directories. There is a useful list of default .gitignore files for many languages here: https://github.com/github/gitignore

If you wish to demonstrate the project live, there will be a Makefile in the template project with instructions on how to edit it to smooth the build and run process of the project.
* The makefile comes prepared with template code for the `build`, `run` and `clean` commands. Please add the necessary commands to perform those actions.
